### Hi there 👋
My name is Sunseehray, and I am an aspiring software developer. When I am not doing school work, I take care of my family's needs. I want to use my skills to build technologies for home management.

* 🌱 I’m currently studying software development at BYU Idaho
* 🔭 I’m currently working on a grocery list web app
* ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a civil engineer
